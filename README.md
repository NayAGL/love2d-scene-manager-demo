# Example Project using LÖVE2D Scene Manager

This is an example project demonstrating the usage of the [love2d-scene-manager](https://github.com/NayAGL/love2d-scene-manager).

## Features
- **Scene Manager Integration**: Handles scene transitions.
- **UI Elements**: Includes interactive buttons and an FPS counter.
- **Sample Game Scene**: Demonstrates basic gameplay mechanics.

## Controls
- **Mouse Left Click**: Interact with buttons.
- **Keyboard Inputs**: `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` & `LShift` for the sample game scene.

> I created this project to help beginners and LÖVE2D users like me get ideas from it and use them as their own. I also tried to structure the code with class-like files (`Button`, `Enemy`, `Player`) using Lua tables, since the language does not support traditional classes. Feel free to modify, improve, and build upon it however you like. Happy coding!~ (✿◡‿◡)
